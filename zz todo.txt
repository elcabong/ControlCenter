server upgrade/install
	servercheck
		need to go over db upgrade check and process
	upgrade process
		create "needs update" overlay to refresh page and load servercheck when upgrades are needed.
		check for updates (phone home) every 24 hours?  this will also perform auth check for registered instances
		when to phone home and check for updates/license
			what calls this?
			display update to users (notification?)
	install process
		server setup
			move servercheck?
			complete serverinstall with servercheck db upgrade part in includes per version
		first time configure:
			steps to complete setup like dropbox.. check off when done..  
				add room
				group room
				apps if needed
				userlist
			how to use popup for first time user log in(mark in userpref/settings table)..  transparent overlay with arrows and comments for various sections... should be available again from users individual settings area


settings refactor:
	ready for testing
		settings-section.php -- pull more global scope variables to top of page (may be complete)
		saving info and refreshing saved div
			need to check saving function now that tables have been changed
	dropdown for http://--https:// for required options
	add ip2wan options for those that have iplan/wan options
	make several levels of "admin" some should have access to everything except users, etc
	import/export db, restrict to super admin and remove "about" settings page
	change user picture naming scheme so there are no collisions
	add user picture when logged in to menu
	screen resize function doesnt work for settings page
	enable/disable function for addons in each room
	

settings - per user (preferences)
	ready for testing:
		make sure that the user can only set preferences for themselves.. or make an admin sub option		
	choose how to display time..  24h vs 12h am/pm
	create preferences_options_allowed table
		this can hold all the options for dropdown menus or acceptable options for user preferences (can have something similar for general settings if needed)


notifications
	include username/user picture when alert sent from person
	create/edit/markread for alerts should be put in a class so alerts can be created like/with logs
	need to limit total notifications shown.  maybe 10/20 with a load more function 
		http://www.umair.io/how-to-create-news-feed-like-facebook-with-php-and-jquery/	
	notifications for updates or other system changes


modal
	create tabbed layout
		tabs only show if multiple tabs are needed
		can add tabs on the fly with an addtab content load into an already opened modal
			maybe each time modal is called, it creates a tab for the option..  dont destroy tabs on modal close..
	update css for modal. currently is nowplaying.css..  needs to be changed to modal.css and all moved into that		
	

functions.php
	sanitize input/strip special characters
		need to identify all areas that require sanitized input
			login (password)
				login username needs to be checked for sql injection (needs to be letter/number only, no special character.  this needs to be checked when creating user names as well)
			alerts
			password reset
			any get/post variables?  or atleast make sure the script fails if they are not expected
			settings?  this is only used by admins, may not need here, or atleast implement last


auth.php -- updated need to test.
	need to figure out better way then checking for if $authsecured is set..  it doesnt get set for users with no passwords
	

main links dropdown (upper right and left)
	make the overlay function better
	better way to do this?


addons:
	update/disable/enable on settings page
		import/export addons
	zoneminder
	xbmc/kodi optimize
	addons.php optimize  --> load to db? or keep as php scan file tree?
	screen for device on but app not responding (orange) like the wol screen
	avr
	create controller page that replaces connecting to xbmc control page
		this will pull items from addons within a room for various control features
		add function to assign addon for control functions
			set vol control to send through thisroom > avr.addon
			interface control to send through thisroom > mediaplayer.addon
			figure out OOP way of doing this?
			styling
